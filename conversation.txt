12/14/24, 15:31 - +61 406 711 009: ?
12/14/24, 15:34 - Donut Beauty: Yes, as I checked both platform documentation, both have decent API that can be connected to Google API
12/14/24, 15:36 - Donut Beauty: Withings API: Provides access to data such as weight, body fat, heart rate, sleep patterns, activity levels, and blood pressure. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and supports real-time data updates via webhooks.
Omron API: Allows access to blood pressure readings and associated fitness activity data. It also supports real-time updates and historical data queries with OAuth 2.0 authentication.
12/14/24, 15:36 - +61 406 711 009: Can you write down properly documention on how it will need to be maintenance?
12/14/24, 15:36 - +61 406 711 009: And cost will be $50?
12/14/24, 15:36 - +61 406 711 009: Which currency?
12/14/24, 15:43 - Donut Beauty: Could you please specify exactly what health metrics you want to sync to Google Calendar? For example:
Blood pressure readings
Weight measurements
Sleep data
Activity data
Any other specific metrics?
12/14/24, 15:43 - Donut Beauty: How frequently would you like the data to sync with Google Calendar? (Real-time, hourly, daily)?
12/14/24, 15:44 - +61 406 711 009: For withings,weight and sleep
12/14/24, 15:44 - +61 406 711 009: For omron: blood pressure and heart rate
12/14/24, 15:44 - +61 406 711 009: All in real time
12/14/24, 15:45 - Donut Beauty: What kind of calendar entries would you like to see? 

Like:
Simple readings as events
Detailed health summaries
Alerts for unusual readings?
12/14/24, 15:46 - +61 406 711 009: Simple reading as events
12/14/24, 15:52 - Donut Beauty: Okay, I've analyzed your requirements in detail, and I want to be transparent about this:

1. The basic version I can offer for $200:
Daily (not real-time) sync of your health data
Basic calendar entries
1 month support period
Implementation in 2-3 days

The full version for $400:
Real-time sync
More detailed calendar entries
1-month support, as well
Error notifications
Proper documentation
Implementation in 3-5 days

I'm offering these options because I want to ensure reliability with your health data. The $50 I've mentioned earlier wouldn't allow me to create a stable, secure solution that you can rely on long-term, as now I understand scope of work better.

Which option would work better for you? P.S. We can have a video call whenever would be comfortable for you.
12/14/24, 15:53 - +61 406 711 009: We can arrange a video call
12/14/24, 15:53 - +61 406 711 009: Tommorow

12/14/24, 16:03 - Donut Beauty: Actually, I'm working with Google Assistant SDK everyday, other than that I'm familiar with Smart Home Api, can add voice commands, cloud fullfilment, implement device state report with Raspberry Pi
12/14/24, 16:03 - +61 406 711 009: Ok good
12/14/24, 16:03 - Donut Beauty: It depends on the devices. What devices do you have available?

12/14/24, 16:05 - Donut Beauty: I can create it quickly, so you can test it with an app. Which app do you have? Do you have the Google Home app?
12/14/24, 16:05 - +61 406 711 009: Yes
12/14/24, 16:05 - Donut Beauty: I had been working on it, but I haven't pushed the changes to GitHub

12/14/24, 16:07 - +61 406 711 009: Thanks
12/14/24, 16:08 - Donut Beauty: Overall, I'd set up a Raspberry Pi as a hub
use Home Assistant or Node red as the automation platform
connect it to Google Home, that's it
12/14/24, 16:09 - +61 406 711 009: Yes that's my main intention
12/14/24, 16:09 - Donut Beauty: Do you already have a Raspberry Pi set up?

12/14/24, 16:09 - +61 406 711 009: But haven't set it up yet
12/14/24, 16:10 - Donut Beauty: Great, set up is not a bid deal, I'm curious which devices you have?
12/14/24, 16:10 - +61 406 711 009: I will put it all down in my proposal
12/14/24, 16:11 - +61 406 711 009: Talk later..

12/14/24, 16:11 - Donut Beauty: Sure, good night. Basically, I don't think there will be any device that I won't be able to work with.
